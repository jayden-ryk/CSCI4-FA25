#in this assignment i used your example and did a bit more research to come to the conclusion I came to, I made sure that if a certain thing didn't work then it would try the next equation, I still don't know how it works. and I also had to make the c = none so the problems would actually compute in the calculator. I still don't feel like its what you asked for but I think it was the best thing I could come up with. It still looks like I have to use multiple functions to get the right steps and so it actually calculates so thats why i think its not what you asked for. I also still can't understand why i put all the elif parts if I still needed to put the o value equaling to -,+,/,*. I don't understand why that part was neccessary if it can't fully compute without me telling it every step. if you have any suggestions please tell me.
